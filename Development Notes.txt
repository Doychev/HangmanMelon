I decided to use BaasBox (http://baasbox.com) for my DB, as it has rather easy integration with Android and is easily maintainable. 
During the first days of development I had some issues with it, but I think now everything is sorted out and I shouldn't have any problems.

The current state of the project is not commented at all, but I'll fix this at some point in time.

Today I started implementing also the ingame logic. I decided that if the word that has to be guessed contains the first and/or the last letters also on the inside of it, the user still has to guess them in order to see them.

Other difficulties I had during the first days of development were related to the asynchrous calls to the DB, but I think I figured it out in a good way.

Over the last 2 days I have been working on the Facebook integration. I had issues with the key hashes of the application and the communication between my application and Facebook due to a strange issue, but I solved it. I posted some of my ideas here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23674131/android-facebook-integration-invalid-key-hash 
I also worked a little bit on the UI, just for having a broad idea of how the application will look.
