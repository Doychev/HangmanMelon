I decided to use BaasBox (http://baasbox.com) for my DB, as it has rather easy integration with Android and is easily maintainable. 
During the first days of development I had some issues with it, but I think now everything is sorted out and I shouldn't have any problems.

The current state of the project is not commented at all, but I'll fix this at some point in time.

Today I started implementing also the ingame logic. I decided that if the word that has to be guessed contains the first and/or the last letters also on the inside of it, the user still has to guess them in order to see them.

Other difficulties I had during the first days of development were related to the asynchrous calls to the DB, but I think I figured it out in a good way.
