Development Notes

I decided to use BaasBox (http://baasbox.com) for my DB, as it has rather easy integration with Android and is easily maintainable. 
During the first days of development I had some issues with it, but I think now everything is sorted out and I shouldn't have any problems.

The current state of the project is not commented at all, but I'll fix this at some point in time.

Today I started implementing also the ingame logic. I decided that if the word that has to be guessed contains the first and/or the last letters also on the inside of it, the user still has to guess them in order to see them.

Other difficulties I had during the first days of development were related to the asynchrous calls to the DB, but I think I figured it out in a good way.

Over the last 2 days I have been working on the Facebook integration. I had issues with the key hashes of the application and the communication between my application and Facebook due to a strange issue, but I solved it. I posted some of my ideas here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23674131/android-facebook-integration-invalid-key-hash 
I also worked a little bit on the UI, just for having a broad idea of how the application will look.

I had some problems with the BaasBox users integration, but I worked them out. Now an administrator user is used to access the DB and all Facebook users are stored in the DB. Those documents will be used for the statistics storage as well. I created a small script which can be used to re-populate the words collection if necessary. I started improving the game logic in general, it is close to done. I also added the pictures for the different error counts during the game. They are in only one size, which may cause bad visualization on different devices, but I have fitted it for my OnePlus One device (running "OxygenOS", based on Android Lollipop; resolution 1080x1920 pixels).

Integrated the Facebook share buttons. Made a DashboardActivity to show statistics. The main app skeleton and functionality is ready. Added "snackbars" to show info during the game.
